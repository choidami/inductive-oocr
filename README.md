# Connecting the Dots: LLMs can Infer and Verbalize Latent Structure from Disparate Training Data

This repository contains the code accompanying our paper: **[Connecting the Dots: LLMs can Infer and Verbalize Latent Structure from Disparate Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14546)**

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into subdirectories for each task (the `functions` directory contains code for both *Functions* and *Mixture of Functions*). Please refer to the individual subdirectories for specific instructions on running the code for each task.

We provide evaluation results and a Jupyter notebook with code for plotting and generating baselines for the *Parity Learning* task in the `parity` directory.
